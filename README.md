## Installation

### Windows

First, download the msi installer.

Double-Click, follow the instructions.

The installer will install the cli binaries on your machine and modify the path environment variable,
so the binary ``mccli.exe`` will be accessible from your CMD console / git bash.

To check the installation, open a console and run ``mccli help``, this should show you the help.

To uninstall, open your control panel, go into uninstall programs and uninstall millicast-cli.

### Ubuntu

Download the debian package.

Then, open a shell and go in your download directory.

Install the package by running: 

```bash

sudo apt install ./millicast-cli-1.0.0-Linux.deb

```

Be sure to update the version to the one you downloaded.

This will install the cli and all its dependencies.

Run ``mccli help`` to check if the installation went well.

Note that if you are using bash, you have the autocompletion available.

To uninstall, run: 

```bash

sudo apt remove millicast-cli

```

### Mac

Download the tar.gz archive.

Go into your download directory and run: 

```zsh

tar zxvf millicast-cli-1.0.0-Darwin.tar.gz

cd millicast-cli-1.0.0-Darwin

sudo chmod +x install.sh

./install.sh

```

Be sure to update the version to the one you downloaded.

This will install the cli in ``/usr/local``.

Run ``mccli help`` to check if the installation went well.

To uninstall, run:

```zsh

chmod +x uninstall.sh

./uninstall.sh

```
